# TinyTapeout 2 submission that rolls a dice.

Will roll a random number from 1 - 6 on the 7-segment display, like a dice.

Contains a LSFR for random numbers, that constantly updates no matter if the dice is rolling or not. Pressing the ’ROLL’ button will play an animation of random numbers cycling on the display, until settling on a number after a few seconds. The decimal point will light up when its done rolling.
